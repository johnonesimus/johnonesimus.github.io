# My Interests


# œï About the 1Phys Project

When I was younger, i was really invested about the anime named One Piece. The main protagonist, Luffy, just wanted absolute freedom, and so he decided to travel the world in hopes of becoming the Pirate King. My version of freedom is just probing the fundamentals of nature, and one of the steps towards that is having a solid understanding and foundation of mathematics and physics to which new knowledge can be added on top of.

## ‚ü® Mathematics ‚ü©

### Course I have taken
Prior to shifting to Physics, I had practically zero mathematics and physics for almost 6 years. I was never truly proficient at both these subjects, but pushed through. My first mathematics course, which I did well was MATH 25 ‚Äì Fundamentals of Calculus. However, I do not count this as a legitimate experience, since I had to take the course during the pandemic, where the only source of grades were problem sets. We had the liberty to consult the internet and the FIC was fairly lenient.

#### MATH 25: Fundamentals of Calculus
Limits and the Basics of Differentiation and Integration of Single and Several Varibles

#### MATH 27: Calculus and Analytic Geometry II
Further Derivatives and Integrals

### MATH 28: Calculus and Analytic Geometry III
Series, Vectors, and Calculus of Several Variables

### PHYS 111: Mathematical Physics I
