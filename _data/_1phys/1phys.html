<h1>The 1Phys Project</h1>

<p>The 1Phys project is a goal to obtain automaticity and a good degree of competency in the Core Mathematical and Physical Subjects before graduating as a Physics major. Although I've had subpar performances in some of my subjects in the past, I am very adamant on going back and obtaining competency especially on the core subjects.</p>

<h2>Mathematics</h2>

<p>Right now, I am using Math Academy, a rigorous Mathematics Program that offers Adaptive Diagnostics, Automation, and a Scientific-driven Pedagogy. They are based in California and are fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). They are also listed in the University of California's Directory of Online Publishers.</p>

<p>For now, I am focusing on their Mathematical Foundations Series which is aimed at adult learners interested in pursuing advanced university courses, but lack the necessary foundational knowledge.</p>

<p>So far I've attained completion on the following:</p>

<h3>Mathematical Foundations 1 (97%)</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>"Solidify your arithmetic, learn about variables and graphs, level up your algebra, and learn the essentials of geometry."</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Mathematical Foundations 2 (71%)</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>"Master the algebra of advanced functions including quadratics, logarithms, and trigonometry. Dive deep into the theory of polynomials, learn the basics of limits, derivatives, and integrals from calculus, and explore a variety of concepts from higher math including complex numbers, vectors, probability, and statistics."</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Mathematical Foundations 3 (23%)</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>"Building on the advanced algebra and basic calculus covered in Mathematical Foundations II, students in Mathematical Foundations III dive deep into the calculus, linear algebra, advanced trigonometry, probability/statistics, and other subjects that form the basis of many higher-level university courses."</p>
