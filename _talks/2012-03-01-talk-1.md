title: "Building a Strong Mathematical Foundation"

---

Currently, I am using Math Academy to build a really strong Mathematical Foundation. I am around 96% on their Mathematical Foundations 1 and 90% on their Mathematical Foundations 2. 
I plan on mastering the Calculus Series, Linear Algebra, and Proof Writing through Math Academy.
